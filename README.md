The Guess My Number Game is a simple browser-based game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players aim to guess a number between 1 and 20. 
The game provides hints; if the guessed number is smaller than the target, it notifies the player that the number is too small, and if the guessed number is larger, it indicates that the number is too big.
The game starts with 20 points, and each incorrect guess deducts 1 point.
